# Assignment-1

This README provides an overview of Assignment-1, which includes the files `form.html`, `index.html` and other necessary folders.

## form.html

The `form.html` file is a part of this assignment and contains a replica form on [https://portal.altschoolafrica.com/auth/create-account](altschoolafrica)that allows users to input their information. It is designed to collect data from the user and can be used for various purposes.

## index.html

The `index.html` file serves as the homepage for the `aboutme.html` page. Instead of creating a separate file for `aboutme.html`, I have utilized the `index.html` file to display the content related to the "About Me" section.
